#elevation correlated, but since we are not aiming to project beyond occurrence records and we are looking to compare geodiversity of the same variable, we keep this predictor. Elith, Phillips, et al. (2010) point out that Maxentâ€™s built-in variable selection (via L1-regularization) is reliable, relatively insensitive to correlation among variables, and model performance may actually be degraded by imposing additional model selection procedures prior to running Maxent! They do suggest that sticking to proximal variables is preferable when projecting models to novel contexts.

  
  #Merow et al. (2013) identify two general approaches to selecting variables. The machine learning approach is based on the understanding that the Maxent algorithm will, by design, select the most useful variables and features, so we can include all reasonable variables.

#However, this probably only applies when the objective is to provide accurate predictions of occurrences in the same context in which the model is built. Efforts to understand the environmental constraints on that distribution, or projecting it to a new context, will be potentially confounded when the model includes correlated variables.
