# Project Title
Can scale-dependent geodiversity improve species distribution models in a montane biodiversity hotspot?

# Project Summary
Knowledge about species’ distributions is essential for conservation, especially in the light of global change. Species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to identify species’ ranges as part of designating their conservation status. Despite the utility of SDMs for conservation, many species are data deficient, especially in montane biodiversity hotspots. Further, SDMs often rely solely on environmental variable means as predictors at single resolutions, yet species are also distributed in relation to environmental heterogeneity, and these relationships are scale-dependent. To capture spatial heterogeneity in the environment, scale-dependent measures of geodiversity can be applied to environmental variables and incorporated into SDMs. These variables offer an opportunity to improve biodiversity and conservation assessments, but their utility for SDMs has not been tested. We test a range of geodiversity variables computed at varying scales of remotely sensed climate and elevation. We compare the performance of Maxent SDMs generated using CHELSA bioclim variables only, to those including geodiversity measures for data poor mammals in montane Colombia. Results suggest that certain scales of geodiversity, such as standard deviation of elevation (SDelev), can improve the ability of SDMs to explain distributions of data poor species. Permutation importance, a measure of variable contribution in Maxent, also increased with spatial resolution of SDelev, signaling that certain measures of geodiversity are more relevant at some scales than others. This study’s open workflow for identifying scales of geodiversity predictors and their SDM performance, will help practitioners make more robust models for data poor species and improve conservation assessments.

## Code & Workflow
This repository contains code and the accompanying workflow for generating geodiversity variables and evaluating their utility for SDMs for multiple mammal species in the Northern Andes. 

This code and workflow allows users to follow the construction of geodiversity variables and subsequent SDMs and also construct relevant outputs.

See ./code/readme.md for more details.
